Contemporary Events Memos 
--------------------------

Students will be asked to complete three contemporary events memos. Each of you will be responsible for submitting a short (3pp, double-spaced) report on some current event or development, one for each of the three countries as we discuss these in the class.

Your memos must discuss how the event you choose relates to some aspect of the class material (the theories, themes, or readings we are discussing in class). You need to consult (and cite properly) 3–4 different news sources, some of which should be European sources (need not be foreign-language publications, however). I will often ask the author to say a few words about his or her memo in class.

The memos will count for 30% of the final grade.

Group Project
-------------

Students will complete a group project on inequality aimed at developing policy recommendations for the United States.

The group project will count for 10% of the final grade.
