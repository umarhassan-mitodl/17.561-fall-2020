Course Description
------------------

This course examines politics and political economy in Britain, Germany, and two Scandinavian countries, Denmark and Sweden. These countries exemplify different types of parliamentary democracies, distinct “varieties of capitalism,” and different welfare state regimes. We will focus on the structure of political power within the state and on differences in the political economies of these countries (what kinds of economic structures, what kinds of links between state and economy, what kinds of welfare regimes and labor market policies are characteristic of these three countries).
